#Crystals Collector

##Overview

Crystals Collector is a web-based numerical guessing game, wherein a player tries to match the value of a randomly generated number by clicking on crystals of different values. 

There are 4 crystals available, each with a different value between 1 and 12. The value of each crystal is not visible to the player and can only be deduced by the amount that their counter increases after click. 

A player wins the game when their counter total is equal to that of the randomly generated number. A player loses the game if their counter total exceeds the randomly generated number. Upon winning or losing the game, the appropriate win/loss counter is updated and the game resets.
